/**
 * Contains the classes responsible for managing the flow of data
 * between the view and model in the Netflix application.
 *
 * <p>This package includes the {@code Controller} class, which serves as an intermediary
 * between the user interface and the application's business logic. It processes user actions,
 * retrieves data from the model, and updates the view accordingly to reflect any changes.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Controller} is also responsible for validating inputs and handling any exceptions
 * that may arise during the interactions between the view and model, ensuring that the application
 * runs smoothly and provides feedback to the user as needed.
 *
 * <p>By following the MVC design pattern, this package promotes a clear separation of concerns,
 * helping to maintain code organization and readability.
