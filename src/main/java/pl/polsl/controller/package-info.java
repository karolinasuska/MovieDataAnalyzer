/**
 * Provides the classes responsible for managing the flow of data
 * between the view and model in the application.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the {@code Controller} class, which acts as an intermediary
 * between the application's user interface and business logic. It processes user
 * actions, retrieves data from the model, and updates the view accordingly.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Controller} also validates inputs and handles any exceptions that
 * may occur during interactions between the view and model, ensuring smooth
 * operation of the application.
